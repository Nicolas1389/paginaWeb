                SEVEN YEARS AGO, the kids couldn’t get enough of arena-ready electronic dance music.
                Scan the Hot 100 today, and the subgenre looks like an endangered species.

                So producers who once waltzed to the top of the charts have been forced to drastically change their approach. 
                Some have been trendy: The Scottish titan Calvin Harris made an album composed entirely of rap and R&B, bowing to the genres that own the streaming-verse. 
                Others have been bold: Skrillex re-made himself as behind-the-scenes Top 40 player with unexpected melodic sensitivity (see Justin Bieber’s “Sorry”), finding other ways to sneak his music into arenas.

                French DJ-producer David Guetta hopes to be both trendy and bold with his new double album 7. The first part is business as usual, stuffed to bursting with the type of cross-genre collaborations that made Guetta a global star.
                Afro-house is now an international dancefloor presence, so South African producer Black Coffee shows up on “Drive.”
                Reggaeton appears more unstoppable with each passing month, so Colombian superstar J Balvin takes the lead on “Para Que Te Quedes.” Lil Uzi Vert phones it in on behalf of the disruptive SoundCloud rap generation on “Motto.”
                There appears to be no musician who doesn’t fit, somehow, in Guetta’s collaborative Venn diagram.
